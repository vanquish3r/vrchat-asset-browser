Lines are assigned to the speaker speaking them, and if the player controls that speaker they get to choose dialog options. There are controls for making certain dialog paths conditional and for triggering sounds and animations and changing the timings of everything and all that. There's also an untested feature that lets you interrupt a conversation with a second conversation, and then go back to that first conversation after the interruption. Conversations are synced but be warned this system generates an Udon Behaviour for every line that's spoken and makes the world take longer to load when you get a couple hundred lines.",

    "Submitted by": "Silent",
    "Notes": "Like all other water shaders with depth-based effects, requires depth buffer for depth effects, so your scene will need a shadow-casting directional light. You can set it to only affect the UIMenu layer to save performance/your world is using only baked lighting.",

It's got refraction, supports Reflection probes, or overriding with your own reflection cubemap. Control of fresnel exponent for reflections, and lots of controls for the ripple texture animations. Update: Also now supports LatLong reflection maps (including from render textures!)",
